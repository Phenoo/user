        <h2>3. Legal basis (for users in applicable jurisdictions)</h2>
        <p>
          Where required, we rely on your consent, performance of a contract,
          legitimate interests (e.g. product improvement), or legal obligations.
        </p>

        </ul>

        <h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
        <p>
          We use third-party services such as analytics, cloud hosting, and
          payment processors. These providers have their own privacy practices;
          please review their policies. We do not control these third parties'
          activities.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Cookies & tracking</h2>

          We implement reasonable administrative, physical, and technical
          safeguards (e.g. encrypted storage, TLS in transit). However, no
          system is 100% secure â€” if you believe your account is compromised,
          contact us immediately at CONTACT_EMAIL.

          comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce
          agreements. You can request deletion of your account; some data may
          remain for legal or operational reasons.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access,
          correct, or delete your personal data, or to object to processing. To
          exercise your rights, contact us at CONTACT_EMAIL.
        </p>

        <h2>10. International transfers</h2>
        <p>
